# Visualizing Relationships: Tackling Data Science through Complex Networks

### ABSTRACT
This workshop is an introduction to Complex Networks analysis and its applications. This field models data as networks of verticies paired by edges in order to extract relationships of interest between datapoints. We will walk through the steps of research together by analyzing popular TV show data. You will walk away with experience using a custom-built python library to extract a variety of characteristics, visualizing important findings, and generating subsequent research questions.

### AUDIENCE

This workshop is intended for intermediate programmers in business and academia looking to explore a new area in data science. Participants must have familiarity with Python and Graph Theory. No data visualization experience is necessary. This workshop is limited to 30 participants but can be scaled to accommodate a larger audience if required. 

### INTRODUCTION
Complex Networks is a new and active area of scientific research concerning graphs with nontrivial topological features. This field focuses on patterns and relationships between data points. The most powerful advantage of this area is that it provides us with a very visual way to analsye and study relationships and trends 

It is already being applied to a variety of different disciplines outside computer science including theoretical math, climatology, epidemiology, and sociology. 


In 2014 researchers employed these techniques to discover that emotional contagion, the transfer of emotion through social networks, takes place through textual interactions alone in large scale, massive social networks such as Facebook.[#ref] This provided evidence that people's emotional state could be influenced through text alone and these results have huge implications for commercial advertising and political campaigning. 

Researchers have also used Complex Network theory to analyse the spread of the Skype service across the world to empirically show that it supports the way in which social contagion, the propensitiy for behaviour by one person to be copied by others, is modelled.[#ref]

In addition to this it has also been applied to (find and reference applications in finance, climatology and epidemiology).

-----------
You may have heard of Facebook's research on emotional contagion (the transfer of emotion through social networks) and the six degrees of separation or "Bacon number". Perhaps you've wondered how exactly we predict the spread of epidemics around the world. Many biological features like neurons and genetics can be modeled by connected nodes.

Complex Networks is a new and active area of scientific research concerning graphs with nontrivial topological features. This field focuses on patterns and relationships between data points.
It is already being applied to a variety of different disciplines outside computer science including theoretical math, climatology, epidemiology, and sociology. A powerful side effect of this type of analysis that often times, the critical findings can be visualized in detailed graphs, enabling us to perceive trends which may be difficult to discern through rows and columns.

### FORMAT

In this workshop, participants will use a python library we create on top of networkX to easily analyze TV show data. Individually or in small groups, they will generate a number of graphs, calculate a set of network properties taught in the introduction, and visualize the results. The goal of the exercise is to learn the power of data visualizations in finding patterns in data as well as the importance of finding the right relationship to focus on. 

This workshop can be scaled to accommodate a larger number of attendees if required.

#### Introduction [15 min]

We will give participants a brief introduction to the field of Complex Networks and the motivations behind it. Following this, we will go over some theory covering the elements of a network, the various ways a network can be represented, and
properties of a network.

### Guided Research [35 min]

Participants will be taught the basic utilities in the python library, and run the provided TV show data through it to generate datasets. As a class they

and examine its properties in order to solve these
puzzles.
The puzzles will range in difficulty from easy to
advanced. The easier puzzles will cover the key
takeaways promised in this workshop while the
more advanced puzzles will be tailored for those
who work more quickly.
The answers to each puzzle will be released every
10 minutes to ensure that all attendees have time
to ask questions and fully understand the answers.
Conclusive Statements (~10 minutes)
In the final 10 minutes of the workshop, we will
provide a summary of some interesting
applications of Complex Network analysis in
various fields of study.
Workshop Materials
All participants will be given access to a GitHub
repository which will contain:
 Presentation slides describing the course
material
 TV show data in JSON format
 Custom built Python library written using
NetworkX
 Sample Python programs
 Troubleshooting tips
OUTCOMES
Upon completion of this workshop, participants will
have gained an understanding of the theory behind
Complex Networks and its applications in Data
Science. Participants will have applied network
theory to construct graphs using TV show data and
analyzed the properties of these graphs in order to
solve puzzles. They will have gained hands-on
experience by applying techniques in this field to
study patterns and relationships between TV
shows and actors. Finally, participants will learn
about a variety of different ways in which Complex
Networks is currently being applied to the real
world in order to gain a bigger picture of the field
as it stands today.
PARTICIPATION STATEMENT
All facilitators will attend the conference and serve
on the workshop if the workshop is accepted.

Maryland College Park Honors College with a BS
in Mathematics and Computer Science. Her
favorite subjects were real analysis and automatatheory.
During college, she founded a traditional
Chinese dance team where she constructed
practice schedules and lesson plans which
accommodated and nurtured all levels of skill from
beginner to pre-professional. She hopes to bring
this passion into teaching technology.
At Bloomberg LP, Tay develops and maintains a
