# Visualizing Relationships: Tackling Data Science through Complex Networks

### ABSTRACT

Complex Networks models data as networks of verticies paired by edges in order to extract relationships of interest between datapoints. Come to this workshop for an introduction to Complex Networks analysis and its many applications. We will walk through the steps of research together by analyzing popular TV show data. You will walk away with experience using a custom-built python library to extract a variety of characteristics, visualizing important findings, and generating subsequent research questions.

### AUDIENCE

This workshop is intended for intermediate programmers in business and academia looking to dabble with data science. Participants must have familiarity with Python and Graph Theory. No data visualization experience is necessary. This workshop is limited to 30 participants.

### INTRODUCTION

You may have heard of Facebook's research on emotional contagion (the transfer of emotion through social networks) and the six degrees of separation or "Bacon number". Perhaps you've wondered how exactly we predict the spread of epidemics around the world. Many biological features like neurons and genetics can be modeled by connected nodes.

Complex Networks is a new and active area of scientific research concerning graphs with nontrivial topological features. This field focuses on patterns and relationships between data points. It is already being applied to a variety of different disciplines outside computer science including theoretical math, climatology, epidemiology, and sociology. A powerful side effect of this type of analysis that often times, the critical findings can be visualized in detailed graphs, enabling us to perceive trends which may be difficult to discern through rows and columns.

### FORMAT

In this workshop, participants will use a python library we create on top of networkX to easily analyze TV show data. Individually or in small groups, they will generate a number of graphs, calculate a set of network properties taught in the introduction, and visualize the results. The goal of the exercise is to learn the power of data visualizations in finding patterns in data as well as the importance of finding the right relationship to focus on. 

This workshop can be scaled to accommodate a larger number of attendees if required.

#### Introduction [15 min]

We will give participants a brief introduction to the field of Complex Networks and the motivations behind it. Following this, we will go over some theory covering the elements of a network, the various ways a network can be represented, and
properties of a network.

#### Guided Research [35 min]

As a room, participants will discuss the possibilities for what can be represented as the nodes and edges. After a runthrough of the basic utilities we provide in the libraries, they will break up into smaller groups and feed the data in and generate the datasets. We will then ask them to use the library to discover key properties.

As groups finish, they will plug their results into a visualization tool. The entire room will discuss how the key properties look when mapped as actual nodes and edges, highlighting the power of the network model. Each group will be asked to brainstorm a follow up research question based on what they see whether it be stripping outliers or grouping datasets into clusters to find further differences. This format allows for a diverse group of experience levels to all learn collaboratively while leaving room for creativity for those who pick up quickly.

#### Conclusive Statements [10 min]
In the final 10 minutes of the workshop, we will provide a summary of some interesting applications of Complex Network analysis in various fields of study, and encourage all participants to look for opportunities in the future to model data in innovative ways when facing problems which haven't been solved through the traditional row-column analysis.

#### Workshop Materials
All participants will be given access to a GitHub repository which will contain:
- Presentation slides describing the course material
- TV show data in JSON format
- Custom built Python library written using NetworkX
- Sample Python programs
- Troubleshooting tips

### OUTCOMES
Upon completion of this workshop, participants will have gained an understanding of the theory behind Complex Networks and its real world impact in Data Science. Participants will have applied network theory to construct graphs using TV show data and analyzed the properties of these graphs in order to answer questions. In the process, they gain hands-on experience studying patterns and relationships. Finally, participants will learn how the field is being applied today.

### PARTICIPATION STATEMENT
All facilitators will attend the conference and serve
on the workshop if the workshop is accepted.

### BIO
Maithu Venkatesh has a BE in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh where she was the President of Hoppers - a group for women in Computer Science. She then earned a MSc in Web Science and Big Data Analytics at University College London. It was here that she discovered her interest in Complex Networks and worked on a research project which became the inspiration for this workshop. At Bloomberg LP, she is a backend software engineer on the News Core Infrastructure team. She is a co-chair of Bloomberg Women in Tech (BWIT) where she organizes external panels on careers in tech and works with Bloomberg recruiting on diversity initiatives. She is also the co-founder and organizer of "Discover-Tech" which operates under BWIT. She helps organize tech talks and focuses on developing a community of junior engineers who enjoy learning about external technologies both through regular meetups and biannual socials.

Tay Nishimura graduated from the University of Maryland College Park Honors College with a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science. Her favorite subjects were real analysis and automatatheory. During college, she founded a traditional Chinese dance team where she constructed put together lesson plans and rehearsal schedules which accommodated all levels of skill. She hopes to bring this passion into teaching technology especially to women starting out in the field. At Bloomberg LP, Tay studies movement data of cargo ships around the world to deduce tradeflows of commodities such as Liquified Natural Gas. She also participates in BWIT as a co-founder of "Discover-Tech" where she primarily schedules and advertises tech talks aimed at coaching and showcasing the talent of junior engineers through presentations on personal projects. Past talks include the history of EDM, backtracking algorithms that create country dances, a workshop on cryptocurrency trading, and custom applications built on the Alexa skills API.
